            PokeDiscovery was created with only one feeling: <span className="font-bold">the love for the game.</span>I try to include the most important information as possible for people to use
            without digesting the non-important information about pokemon.
          </p>

          <p className="text-2xl">
            The website has a 'responsive' design which is a layout that proved to work well with mobile, as well as desktop. You will be able to see the various different tools I used in order to
            create this website, as well as links to other websites which helped me develop this project.

          <p>
            {" "}
            PokeDiscovery currently includes data on every pokemon up to generation 8. In order to include the latest generation, I would need to create my own api from scratch, which would take a
            very long time so I opted to use the famous, public RESTful PokeApi.
          </p>

          <p>We also have data on Abilities, Items, Stat Comparison, and a brief description of every single region on my main page.</p>

            <p>
              There were various tools that I used when creating this website. These include HTML, CSS , Javascript , React , TailwindCSS and Vite. In short, it was mostly a Front-end Project I
              created and will forever be in development because of Vast information the pokemon games bring. Unless more developers are keen in the websites development!
