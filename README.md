App Details & Build

PokeDiscovery was created with only one feeling: the love for the game.I try to include the most important information as possible for people to use without digesting the non-important information about pokemon.

The website has a 'responsive' design which is a layout that proved to work well with mobile, as well as desktop. You will be able to see the various different tools I used in order to create this website, as well as links to other websites which helped me develop this project.

<strong>What does PokeDiscovery Include?</strong> </br>

PokeDiscovery currently includes data on every pokemon up to generation 8. In order to include the latest generation, I would need to create my own api from scratch, which would take a very long time so I opted to use the famous, public RESTful PokeApi.

We also have data on Abilities, Items, Stat Comparison, and a brief description of every single region on my main page.

<strong> Who is the Creator? </strong> </br>
The creator is currently a recent graduate from university and goes by the name Umut Eroglulari. You may find his information on the websites about page.
